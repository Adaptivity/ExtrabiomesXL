#### How to install and use the source code ####

1. Download the latest recommended MinecraftForge src distribution.
2. Extract the Forge src zip file and run install.bat/.sh in the forge folder.
3. Clone this git repo to whatever location you like.
4. Use the eclipse folder in your Forge/MCP setup as your Eclipse workspace.
5. Under the Minecraft project, add the "common" and "resources" folders in the git repo as linked folders and set both as source folders.

#### How to build from the source code ####

1. Download and install Apache Ant on your system. Make sure it is available on the path environment variable.
2. In the EBXL repo folder, make a copy of build.properties_example and name it build.properties.
3. Edit the values in build.properties to contain valid paths on your system for the 3 properties. Details can be found in build.properties_example.
4. From a console window run "ant" from the ExtrabiomesXL repo folder. The build will create its output in the bin folder.
5. Install the resulting mod archive by copying it to the mods folder on the client or server. The mod is universal and works on both the client and the server.
