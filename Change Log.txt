=====
 - Fixed so cracked sand must have maximum light (full sunlight) to grow.
 - Fixed server/client version mismatch
 - Changed requirements so that classic mode server does not require Extrabiomes to be installed on the client. (Though the client still needs to have Forge.)
 - Fixed broken tree generation on client.
